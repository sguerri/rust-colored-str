> Coloring terminal by parsing string content

This crate is an extension to the [colored](https://crates.io/crates/colored) crate that enables terminal coloring. It provides a trait and a macro to parse a given string that incorporates style flags.

**Main features**
 - Translate [colored](https://crates.io/crates/colored) features into string templating
 - Multiple styles and substyles in one same string
 - Macros to replace `format!` and `println!` with colored strings

## Usage

This crate is [on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/colored-str) and can be used by adding `colored-str` to your dependencies in your project's `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
[dependencies]
colored-str = "0.0.2"
```

## How to use

Styles must be written within `<...>` opening flag and `</>` closing flag.

Style variations must be written within `<+...>` opening flag and `<->` closing flag.

See below examples.

## Limitations

**Blocks cannot be overlapped**  
Such code `<red> ... <blue> ... </> ... </>` will not work properly.  
This is true as well for variations : `<red><+blue> ... <+bold> ... <-><-></>` will not work properly.  

**A style cannot be removed**  
With `<red+bold> ... here I want to keep red only => impossible </>`.  
The workaround is as follows: `<red> <+bold> ... <-> here I have red only </>`

## Examples

```rust
use colored_str::coloredln;

coloredln!("<red>this is red</>");
coloredln!("<#FF0000>this is also red</>");
coloredln!("<blue+red>this is red again</>");
coloredln!("<red+on_blue>this is red on blue</>");
coloredln!("<red+on_#0000FF>this is also red on blue</>");
coloredln!("<bold>this is bold</>");
coloredln!("<red>there is a first line\nthen a second</>");
```

You can add variables as per `println!`

```rust
use colored_str::coloredln;

let message = "this is red";
coloredln!("<red>{message}</>");
coloredln!("<red>{}</>", message);
```

You can add styles adjustments in a block

```rust
use colored_str::coloredln;

coloredln!("<red>this is red <+bold>this is red and bold<-> then red again </>");
coloredln!("<red>this is red <+bold+on_blue>this is red on blue and bold<-> then red again </>");
```

You can also use it as a trait

```rust
use colored_str::Colored;
let s: String = "<red>this is red</>".colored().to_string();
println!("{}", s);
```

## Issues

Contributions, issues and feature requests are welcome!

I am quite new to rust, so I guess many things can be improved. I mainly test on linux also, so tests on other platforms are welcome.
